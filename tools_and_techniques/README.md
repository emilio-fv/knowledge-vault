# Tools & Technologies
- Metasploit
- Bash

With each new tool or tech I learn, I try to answer the following questions before diving any deeper into learning to use the tool:
1. What problem does this tool or tech solve?
2. What are the key features & capabilities? Limitations?
3. Who is the primary audience or user base?
4. What are the common use cases?

I find being able to answer these questions saves me quite a bit of time with troubleshooting and accomplishing the desired task. It's easy to forget that you don't know what you don't know. 

In addition to the fundamentals, the following areas are covered:
- Architecture & Design
- Installation & Setup
- Operation & Usage
- Integration & Compatibility
- Performance & Optimization
- Security
- Troubleshooting & Maintenance
- Alternatives & Comparisons
- Practical Applications
